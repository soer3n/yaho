## Overview

In general the procedure is nearly similar to well-known helm cli. At first you've to deploy a repository or repositories depending on the charts you want to use for your planned releases. After that you can use this prepared environment for deploying resources. It's just not local at your workstation but in your cluster. Sure there are some different behaviours when we come to the details. Also caused by the number of involved people.
