## TODOs

- add assertions for tests; currently there are more or less only the normal cases covered
- handle func calls with context.Context if actually needed
- syncing state of releases continiously (check if there changes due to manual actions)
- switching to previous revision and back
- auto-sync for new chart versions from repository
- black- and whitelisting for charts when auto-sync for repository is enabled
